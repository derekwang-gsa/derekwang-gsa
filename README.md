Work style preferences
Jot down any working style preferences you have below.  Consider making notes about your working hours or communication habits. 

Examples - feel free to delete this block
I need a lot of uninterrupted heads-down time and feel distracted by collaborative, chatty coworking.  (Or... I like to think out loud with my coworkers to figure things out!)
I prefer to have meetings in the afternoon. 
I don’t watch the chat during video meetings; please feel free to interrupt or raise your hand if you have something to say
I do a lot of long-form writing, and prefer asynchronous communication to video calls.
